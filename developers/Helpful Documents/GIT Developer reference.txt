1.	Modify objects on c:\github\oasbog
2.	All supporting docs go to c:\github\oasbog.wiki
3.	Open gitbash
	a.	Goto oasbog.wiki
	b.	Run oasbog. #<issue number>.shl.asciidoc
	c.	This will create a folder c:\github\oasbog. #<issue number>
4.	Now test your modified objects, by running the file oasbog.#1.sql.asciidoc  under c:\github\oasbog#<issue number>
5.	Check your log 
	a.	if everything ok, commit and push (explained below)
